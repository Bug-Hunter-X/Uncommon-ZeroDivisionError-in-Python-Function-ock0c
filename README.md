This repository contains a Python code snippet that demonstrates a less obvious case of a ZeroDivisionError. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` attempts to handle division by zero by checking if either the numerator or denominator is zero. However, it fails to handle the case where both are zero. The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version.  The error highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling, even for seemingly simple cases.
